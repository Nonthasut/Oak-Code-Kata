    <p><u>The Millionaire Fastlane</u> by <u>MJ DeMarco</u>
    This book is about prediction of case what you will become in last if your live like your are <b><i>immortal</i></b>. 
    The author separate people in 3 group from how their spend and think about time and money.
    In my opinion I can said,the Cover and title name of this book both like '<b><i>useless</i></b> investing book' that your can met everywhere but it's not.
    the group in case that book's content 
    <li>The people who do not have <b><i>responsible</i></b> about income. (foot path)</li>
    <li>The people who <b><i>responsible</i></b> about income but they just live like they're <b></i>immortal</b></i>.(Traffic jam path) </li>
    <li>The real man who realizes you cannot be immortal and doesn't want to be Wheelchair Millionaire.(Fastlane)</li>
    <b><i>Basically</i></b> it's not the 'how to book'. Every case in book proof everything by <b><i>logically and Mathematical</i></b>.
    Easy way to be Millionaire that the bull shit and just the dream on. But fast way to be Millionaire is real and the hardest way.
    P.S. The author is Millionaire from the way he wrote in book not from this book , <b><i>cheat</i></b> way or misdirection way like the other Millionaire do.
